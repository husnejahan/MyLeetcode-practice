# Prepare For Coding Interviews
Set of coding problems from Leetcode, Firecode, Lintcode I do to prepare for Software Engineer coding interviews

## Resources
Website I use to practice:
- [**Leetcode**](https://www.leetcode.com) : I started off with easy problems related to basic algorithms (DFS, BFS, tree traversal, binary search etc) and data structures (array, linked list, graph, binary tree, etc) and do at least 3 medium and 1 hard problems each week. Leetcode is useful as you get to compare your code's runtime with others. Discussion section is helpful if you need extra help or want to explore different approaches to a problem. 

- [**Firecode**](https://www.firecode.io) : Firecode is useful to start with. It divides problems into 5 levels and you have to ace each level to move on to the next. It also shows where each question comes from. Most of the problems are from big companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, IBM, etc. If you are interviewing for these companies, I highly recommend using Firecode. Best part is it's 100% free

- [**Lintcode**](http://www.lintcode.com/contest/) : If you are interviewing for a specific company in the big 4 (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon), go to Lintcode contest section and do mock interviews. It features real interview questions and have them sorted in different rounds of interviews (phone screen, onsite, etc). I have seen questions from Lintcode in real interviews so I highly encourage you to try it out!

## Mock interview website
Website I use to prepare for technical phone interviews:
- [**Pramp**](https://www.pramp.com) : Pramp lets you pair up with another Pramp user and take turn to be the interviewer and the interviewee. Putting yourself in the shoe of an interviewer helps you to internalize the dos and don'ts in an interview. It's 100% and you will receive constructive feedback after each interview!

- [**Interview.io**](https://interviewing.io) : Similar you Pramp, Interview.io is a live peer-2-peer platform to practice coding interview. One main difference is you don't take turn interview each other. You can either choose to be the interviewer or the interviewee but don't have to do both at once. Interview.io is still in beta mode and is limiting on booking interview schedule. 

## Other good resources:
Books:
- [**Cracking the coding interview**](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. This is the bible of every software engineer to prepare for technical interview. It's a must read!

- [**Algorithms to live by: The computer science of human decisions**](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1627790365) : I read this book to better understand how data structures and algorithms can be applied in real life.
